# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Dataset

The dataset used is diabetes.csv, which includes the following columns:

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Outcome variable (0 or 1) where 1 represents the presence of diabetes and 0 represents the absence of diabetes.

<!-- ## Objective -->

<!-- The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not using logistic regression. -->

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Run the code to:

- Explore the dataset and its basic statistics.
- Visualize various features and their relationships.
- Train a logistic regression model and evaluate its performance on diabetes prediction.
